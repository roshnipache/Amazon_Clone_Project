# 🛒 Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a simple Amazon clone website built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It's my very first web development project, created to practice structuring web pages and styling them to look like a real e-commerce site.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Creating layouts with HTML
- Styling pages with CSS
- Using Flexbox and Grid
- Building a responsive navbar
- Organizing content into sections (like header, product grid, footer)

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Make the design more responsive for mobile devices
- Add interactivity using JavaScript (like a working cart)

- Add product filtering and search bar functionality
