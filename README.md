# ðŸ›’ Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS)

This is a simple Amazon clone website built using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It's my very first web development project, created to practice structuring web pages and styling them to look like a real e-commerce site.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Creating layouts with HTML
- Styling pages with CSS
- Using Flexbox and Grid
- Building a responsive navbar
- Organizing content into sections (like header, product grid, footer)

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots

_(Replace `#` with your GitHub Pages link if you deployed it!)_

## ðŸŒ± Future Plans

- Make the design more responsive for mobile
